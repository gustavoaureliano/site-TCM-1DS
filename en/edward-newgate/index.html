                    Edward Newgate was the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates, he is more commonly known as Whitebeard and, after Gol D. Roger's death, also known as "The Strongest Man in the World" and the "Man Closest to One Piece".

                </p>

                <p>

                    He was one of the Four Emperors, the four pirates those rule the New World. Before being the captain of his own crew he was a member of the legendary Rocks Pirates, they ruled the seas before the rise of Gol D. Roger and his crew.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Edward Newgate was an orphan who grew up in poverty, that’s why he always wanted for a family and thinks it's the greatest treasure one could have. He cares of his crew as a father, and they are usually very loyal to him, although one of the members of his crew, <a href="../marshall-d.-teach/">Marshal D. Teach</a>, had killed a crewmate and stole his akuma no mi.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Ace, another member, went after <a href="../marshall-d.-teach/">Teach</a> to get revenge, but he was captured by the Marines and was about to be executed in the Marines Head Quarter, Edward Newgate started a war against Marines to recover Ace, it was the greatest war since the Golden Age of Pirates, but unfortunately he and his crewmate, Ace, were killed.
