                    Marshal D. Teach is the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates, he is generally known as Blackbeard and is one of the Four Emperors those rule the New World. Also, he is the only one known in the history to have the power of two Akuma no Mi, something considered impossible.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Before being the captain of his own crew he was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates in the second division, but when Thatch, the fourth division commander, found an Akuma no Mi Teach murdered him, stole his Akuma no Mi and ran with it.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Ace, a member of Whitebeard Pirates, went after Teach to get revenge, but he was defeated and captured by Teach who gave him to the Marines in order to join the Shichibukai, a group of seven pirates allied to the World Government and the Marines.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The capture of Ace caused a war between the Whitebeard Pirates and, the Marines, the greatest war since the Golden Age of Pirates, it was at the Marines Head Querter where Ace was about to be executed in public. Teach has murdered <a href="/en/edward-newgate/">Whitebeard</a> and somehow stole the power of his Akuma no Mi, Gura-Gura no Mi, becoming the only one to have the power of two Akuma no Mi, Ace was killed by the Vice-admiral Akainu while saving Luffy's life.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The remainder of the Whitebeard Pirates sought for revenge against Teach, led By Marco, they had brought all their forces in order to engage Teach, but they were totally defeated by him, teach had left the Shichibukai and after that he became known as one of the Four Emperors taking <a href="/en/edward-newgate/">Whitebeard</a>'s place.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Before becoming a Shichibukai and later one of the Four Emperor his bounty was just <span class="textnowrap">฿ 0</span>, but currently he has as bounty of <span class="textnowrap">฿ 2 247 600 000</span>, he was the last one to join the Four Emperor and this is the lowest bounty value among them, but is a really high value compared to the other pirates.
